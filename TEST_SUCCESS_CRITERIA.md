# Test Success Criteria for Weak Signal Tracker

This document outlines the test success criteria for the Weak Signal Tracker application based on the PRD requirements.

## Core User Flows

### 7.1 Adding a New Signal
- ✅ User can click "Add Signal" button to open the modal
- ✅ Modal appears with fields: Title, Source/Context, Why It Matters, Category/Tags
